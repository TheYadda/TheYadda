# Hey!
Hi, I’m Ellie! A UCSD student (est. grad date Fall 2024, BS Computer Science) primarily with experience in the Unity game engine and OpenGL and with an overall interest is in VR/AR technology. I also dabble in Python and some web development.

I don't really work on personal projects often; most of my repositories are private repos of class projects. Class project repos will be made public in the coming weeks. Anything that is public is provided with no warranty and no promise of future support.

I can be reached at mdmoriss AT ucsd PERIOD edu
