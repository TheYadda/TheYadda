# Hey!
Hi, I’m Emma! A UCSD student (est. grad date 2023, BS Computer Science) primarily experienced in the Unity game engine and OpenGL and with an overall interest is in VR/AR technology.

I don't really work on personal projects often; most of my repositories are private repos of class projects. Anything that is public is provided with no warranty and no promise of future support.

I can be reached at memmam AT emmaline PERIOD dev / mdmoriss AT ucsd PERIOD edu
