# Hey!
Hi, I’m Ellie! I'm a recent UCSD Computer Science graduate currently seeking employment, primarily with experience in OpenGL, the Unity game engine, and VR/AR technology. I also dabble in Python and some web development.

I don't really work on personal projects often; most of my repositories are private repos of class projects. Class project repos will be made public in the coming months. Anything that is public is provided with no warranty and no promise of future support.

I can be reached at contact AT ewilliams PERIOD dev
